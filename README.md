----

**My notes:**
>  * TDD --> Testing driven development. (Test the code --> if it failed --> refactor the code)   

> * CI, CD --> test each single line in my code or in my application ‘app’ if it passes so I can merge. The testing is automated from GitHub. For local test we use npm test command if all pass, we do push all the changes to test our app using GitHub actions.

 

> * Also, we learned how to have a spirited file for a middleware, and that the middleware it a normal function. I can have middleware as much as I need depend on my application. and how to export them using (module.exports)
